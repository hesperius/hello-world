# hello-world
My first project in a whole new world.

The marks the beginning of my coding summer and the journey towards collaborating with others on Github! There just seem to be so many things to do related to CS, with many potential projects and life paths that are very attractive. Hopefully someday I'll be either working at a sweet company with neat-o projects or freelancing from a beach in Sri Lanka and working on my own ideas. To the first step in a whole new world.
